We are building an application to help sellers manage and cross-list their products across multiple marketplaces, and it’s going to be called CrossList App. It will allow users to import, edit, and synchronize their product listings across platforms like eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, and Facebook Marketplace. The app will integrate with Firebase for backend services and authentication, and the UI will be designed with Vite (React) and Base44 components.
