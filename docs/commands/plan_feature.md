# Plan Feature  

**Feature**: Bulk CSV Upload for Inventory  

**Description**  
We want to add a feature that allows users to upload a CSV file of products, validate the entries, preview them, and then save them into Firebase.  

**Technical Plan**  
1. **Frontend (React)**  
   - Build a CSV file upload interface.  
   - Parse CSV into JSON using `papaparse`.  
   - Display a preview table for user confirmation.  

2. **Validation**  
   - Ensure required fields: {title, price, category, images}.  
   - Highlight invalid rows.  

3. **Backend (Firebase)**  
   - Store product data in Firestore.  
   - Upload images to Firebase Storage if provided.  
   - Batch writes for efficiency.  

4. **Error Handling**  
   - Clear messages for invalid files.  
   - Retry mechanism for failed uploads.  

**Dependencies**  
- papaparse (CSV parsing)  
- Firebase SDK (Firestore + Storage)
